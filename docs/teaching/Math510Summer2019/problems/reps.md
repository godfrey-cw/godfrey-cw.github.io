Representation theory
=====================

### Fall 2018 Problem 7

### 2017 Problems 5, 7, 8

### 2016 Problem 8

### 2015 Problem 5

### 2014 Problems 7, 8

### 2012 Problems 2, 4


### 2011 Problem 6


### 2010 Problems 3, 8


### 2009 Problem 7


### 2008 Problem 7


### 2007 Problem 6

We already did this one, but see if you can find a different proof using representation theory. **Hint**: an earlier problem in this set describes the representations of $\mu_{7}$ (or $\mathbb{Z}/7$ if you want) over $\mathbb{Q}$.


### 2006 Problem 4

This also involves Galois theory, but we may as well get cracking on it this week. 


### 2003 Problem 5


### 2002 Problems 2, 3, 8

Again, we already did problem 3, but see if you can do it with representation theory.
