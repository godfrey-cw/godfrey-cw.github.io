# Math 307H/I Winter 2019 Syllabus

## Brief overview

This is a course about ordinary differential equations, the tools used
to solve them and some of their ''real world'' applications. The two
types of differential equations we will focus on are first order
equations and second order linear equations - we will also discuss the
Laplace transform.

## Web resources

-   The main website is
    <https://sites.math.washington.edu/~cgodfrey/teaching/Math307Winter2019/>. 
-   For homework we will use WebAssign (see below), and grades will be
    posted to Canvas (which you can access via MyUW).


## Expectations

I recommend:

-   Reading the textbook (even if you normally don't read
    textbooks). The sections covered in lectures will be posted on the
    class website - the optimal strategy would be to read these sections
    before class.

-   Doing all of the homework problems - one does not simply learn to
    solve differential equations from reading the book and watching
    someone (for instance, me) work them out on a board. This is
    perhaps an extreme example of a skill that is best learned by doing.

-   Perhaps most importantly, asking questions and participating in class.

**What do you expect of me as a teacher? Don't hesitate to let me know,
either in person or via an email.**


## Textbook

*Elementary differential equations and boundary value problems, 10th
ed.* by William E. Boyce and Richard C. DiPrima, available at the UW
Bookstore. There is a custom UW version including only the chapters
needed for this class, as well as the original text which covers
material from both Math 307 and 309 (so, if you plan to take Math 309
you will probably want the entire book). 

\*NOTE: since we are using WebAssign for homework, you don't need the
 most recent version of the text. An economical option would be
 getting a used copy of the 8th or 9th edition.\*

There is also a copy of the book on reserve at Odegaard
Library.


## Homework

All homework will be assigned, completed and turned in via
[WebAssign](http://www.webassign.net/washington/login.html). To get
started go to <http://www.webassign.net/washington/login.html>  


## Grades

Per UW policy, the median grade for this class will be 3.0 \(\pm \)
0.2. Here's the percentage weight of homework and exams:

</tbody>
</table>


## Exams

There will be two 50 minute midterms during our usual class time on
February 1st and March 1st, and a 1 hour and 50 minute final from
2:30-4:20 on March 21st (H section) or 4:30-620 on March 18 (I
section) on March 21st in our usual classroom (Smith 105).


## Calculators, software and notes

You may use a non-graphing scientific calculator, comparable to those
allowed in the 120-level math courses at UW. You may bring a
handwritten, 2-sided 8.5 $\times$ 11 sheet of notes to the exams .

There's a wide variety of mathematical software that can be used to solve differential
equations, and I encourage you to become familiar with some of it. If
you are looking for a place to start, take a look at Mathematica or Matlab - you
can access them in the library computer labs (Mathematica in any of
the labs, Matlab in some of them, e.g. most Engineering computer
labs). For a free, open-source alternative, check out Sage.  


## Late homework, makeups

Late homework cannot be accepted, as solutions are posted after the
due date. If you need to miss
an exam to observe a religious holiday or attend a university
sponsored event, you must make arrangements at least a week in
advance, and provide documentation of your absence. Make-up exams will
not be given. If you miss a *midterm* exam for unavoidable, compelling and
well-documented reasons, more weight will be assigned to the other
exams in your final grade. **To pass the class you must take the final
exam**, so please double check the posted final exam time and make sure
you are able to attend it.


## Other resources

The Center for Learning and Undergraduate Achievement (CLUE) offers
drop-in tutoring and exam review sessions - see their website
(<http://depts.washington.edu/aspuw/clue/home/>) for more details. The
UW chapter of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) organizes
a study hall before final exams - you should see an email about that
later in the quarter.  


## Academic integrity

\subsection*{Academic integrity}

I take this very seriously. Information about what constitutes
academic misconduct and the possible consequences can be found here:
